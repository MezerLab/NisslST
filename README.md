# NisslST

This code accompnies the paper "The glial framework reveals white-mtter architecture in human and primate brains" (Schurr and Mezer, 2021, submitted).
It is used for performing structure-tensor analysis to Nissl-stained histological slices, to visualize and quantify glial-row orientation.

Requirements: 
The Structure tensor tool box associated with the paper "Structure tensor based analysis of cells and nuclei organization in tissues".
